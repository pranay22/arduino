The Road Less Taken
-------------------
Two roads diverged in a wood,
I am one traveler, long I stood.
I took the smaller, to be fair,
It was grassy and wanted wear.
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took the one less traveled by.
Someday in future, ages hence,
This will have made, all the difference.
