# Altair 101 Computer
  
I have designed and built an Altair 8800 computer emulator.
The mother board, CPU, and RAM, is an Arduino Mega microcontroller.
The case is from the [Adwater & Stir emulator kit](https://www.adwaterandstir.com/product/altair-8800-emulator-kit/).
LED lights, toggles, chips, and other components are from China factories.
Together, it emulates the basic Altair 8800 hardware from 1975.
It emulates more than enough of the 8080/8085 microprocessor machine instructions (opcodes),
to run the classic program, Kill the Bit. 
Running Kill the Bit, was major milestone as it's the quasi essential Altair 8800 demonstration program.

I added modern I/O components:
an SD card to save and load program memory,
a real time clock to display the time and date,
and an MP3 player and amp to play sounds and music.

The project started late October 2019 after seeing an Altair 8800 as a background prop in the UK TV series, IT Crowd.
It re-sparked my interest. I found there were a number of clones.
I began with a study of the clone videos.
The [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suyiMfzmZKs) was a great intro to using an Altair.

My [steps](READMEhistory.md) to build the machine.

[User guide](READMEuserGuide.md) to use the machine.

Since my Altair 101 development machine is working properly, I can show my steampunk tablet to the world.
Time to generate videos.
