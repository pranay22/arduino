# Clock

Clock I made using an Arduino Nano, 
DS3231 clock module, 5 shift register(SN74HC595N) chips, LEDs and wires.
The wooden frame was built using skills learned in my high school shop classes.

The frame was built 20 years ago.
I had a TTL version of the clock.
I was using 555 chip as the timer, which was not accurate at all.
The DS3231 keeps excellent time.

It was one of my teenager life goals, to build a clock, that I have finally achieved.

### Notes

I had to build a number of test circuits before building my clock,
+ Clock program to display the time in the Arduino IDE serial monitor.
+ Clock program to set the time.
+ Using one shift register(SN74HC595N).
+ Using multiple shift registers.
+ Clock circuit to display the time using the shift registers and LED lights.
+ Circuit to count from 0-9 on a 7 segment digit display.
+ Clock circuit to display using two 7 segment digit displays, and shift registers and LED lights.
