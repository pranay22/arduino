Implement a Call Work Flow System
This exercise will walk you through the steps to configure your Twilio phone number to receive calls and put the callers into a queue. The callers will listen to music while TaskRouter arranges an agent to take their call.
+ Configure your Twilio TaskRouter Workspace.
+ Create an IVR, using Studio, to welcome the caller and put them into the TaskRouter queue.
+ Configure your Twilio phone number to use the Studio IVR.
+ Deploy the TaskRouter Worker application and set the environment variables.
+ Test the call work flow system.
