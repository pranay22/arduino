### Program Overview

Working projects:
+ MP3 player using a DFPlayer module.
+ Pong game.
+ Various clocks using a DS3231 real time clock module with LED lights, 7 segment display, and 1602 LCD, for output.
    Using infrared or toggles to set the time.
+ Handheld internet console to play tic-tac-toe game using a keypad and an ESP8266 NodeMCU.
+ Altair 8800 computer emulator.

Component programs:
